INSTALLATION
============

First unpack the kit, if you have not already done so:

   gzip -d < Getopt-Long-x.y.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd Getopt-Long-x.y

Getopt::Long can be installed with:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make all test
   make install

This will install Getopt/Long.pm, newgetopt.pl and the Getopt::Long
documentation. Note that "make install" will usually require super
user privilege unless your Perl is installed in a location you have
write access to.

It is also possible to use the CPAN or CPANPLUS tools to install
Getopt::Long directly from CPAN, e.g.,

  perl -MCPAN -e "install Getopt::Long"

RPM fans can try "rpm -ta Getopt-Long-x.y.tar.gz".

The kit contains an "examples" directory with some program skeleton
files that can be used to start writing application programs. It uses
Getopt::Long in a standard way, automatically providing version and
help information. For the latter, it uses the Pod::Usage module to
extracts help texts from the embedded documentation. The Pod::Usage
module is part of standard Perl as of Perl version 5.6. For older
versions of Perl, it can be fetched from CPAN. Use
http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Pod-Parser.
